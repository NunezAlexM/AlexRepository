        <p> My name is Alex Nunez and I am a student at Alfred state college. I am 21 years old and my major is Digital Media & Animation. If you would like to see some of my work, click the link <a href="https://nunezalexdma.wordpress.com/" target= "_blank">here</a>. I first started getting into animation after I watched Star Wars Episode 1. This is also why Star Wars has such a big influence in my life. I grew up in Fishkill, New York and I am very excited to show AND tell you guys what makes me who I am. Since the start of Covid-19, I have been brushing up on my drawing skills, detailing my car, joyrides to the mall, and picked back up on a lot of gaming and movies.</p>
